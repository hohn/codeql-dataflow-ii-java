* SQL injection example
  This is a more advanced version of
  https://github.com/advanced-security/codeql-workshops-staging/tree/master/java/codeql-dataflow-sql-injection

  Initial results should show a false positive, and false negative (missing path).
  To that end:
  - false negative: db write using struct => dataflow won't work, taint-tracking
    should.  Debug using partial paths.  Add some extra library function so that
    additional taint steps are needed to propagate.
  - false positive: second write using safe sql command (pre-compiled), initially
    shown as false positive (will be sanitizer).  Add a checking-function in this
    path also (integer from string?).  This one will become a barrier function.
